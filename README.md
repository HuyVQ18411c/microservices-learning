# Microservices Architecture in my nutshell
Inspired by my line manager and my works. 

Working with microservices is hyped (for me)! I hated it at first, since I worked with so many monolithic applications in the past, I embrace it simplicity and elegant for start ups, for someone who is looking for a starting point. However, after a decent period (a year) I learn and grow with microservices architecture, I fall in love with the beauty of handling problems of it. Simplify a big (app) problem by split it to multiple small (services) problems which is also true in resolve issues in real life.
